# Ellicious ✨ Discord AI Conversation Bot
Ellicious is a Discord selfbot using AI powered by [character.ai](https://beta.character.ai) to create natural conversations with people on Discord. It currently has the ability to respond to people in dms and servers. However, it can not at the moment tell apart different persons. This will come very soon.

It uses the [unofficial character.ai node.js wrapper](https://github.com/realcoloride/node_characterai) by [realcoloride](https://github.com/realcoloride), as well as the [discord.js-selfbot](https://github.com/aiko-chan-ai/discord.js-selfbot-v13) for using Discord's API.
